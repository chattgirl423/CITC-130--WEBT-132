            <h2>Level Up Your Singing Skills?</h2>
            <p>It takes time and lots of effort to learn and
                perfect a new skill. “Singing is a learned skill.” Each student must be motivated and exhibit
                determination to
                improve individual performance capabilities. Therefore, practice is key. Practicing includes
                both under
                a
                teacher’s supervision and in individual private practice. Time set aside for 2 to 3 practice
                sessions each week
                will
                allow the student to build their voice and make progress.</p>
