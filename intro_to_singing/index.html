    <h2>Breath Support</h2>
    <p>Imagine you're singing along to your favorite song. It's the best part of the song, you know that section when
        the artist holds out that big long note. You decide to just "go for it!" As you start to belt out and hold that
        big long note, suddenly your voice begins to shake and crack and you run out of air. Gasping, to take your next
        breath, you realize that you totally missed the mark! Sound familiar? Have you ever felt short of breath as you
        struggled to hold out a note when singing a verse of a song? Cultivating proper Breath Support will allow you to
        have more breath control. Breath Support is pivotal in order to sustain each pitch duration accurately while
        singing. Learning to engage your diaphragm while singing will allow you to achieve appropriate breath support.
        The diaphragm is a muscle that sits below the lungs and plays a crucial role in the process of breathing. </p>

    <h2>Posture</h2>
    <p>Can you think back to the last time you heard a band perform live. How did they sound? How well were the
        acoustics? Hopefully when the musicians performed they were sure to position each instrument so the listeners or
        audience could enjoy their melodic sounds. You may have heard the expression “Your body is an instrument.” This
        is true for every singer regardless of your experience. Hence, to develop skills for a “solid singing technique”
        good Posture is key. Posture is import when singing as proper stance for singing allows air to flow freely down
        your windpipe and pass through your lungs allowing your listeners to enjoy your melodic sounds too.</p>
