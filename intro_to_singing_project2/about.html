            <h2>About Intro to Singing</h2>
            <p>Introduction to Singing was founded in January 2024 by Voice Coach Amecia. We are passionate about vocal
                education and using technology to help educate others. Introduction to singing was created for all
                people that love to sing regardless of their level of vocal skill. Learning to sing takes time but the
                benefits are well worth the effort and time spent. Thru education we hope to assist others learn the
                rudiments of singing to enhance each singerâ€™s individual vocal technique from the comforts of their
                home. Hence, we desire everyone to experience the joy of singing with confidence.
