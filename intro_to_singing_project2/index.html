            <h3>Breath Support</h3>
            <p>Imagine you're singing along to your favorite song. It's the best part of the song, you know that section
                when
                the artist holds out that big long note. You decide to just "go for it!" As you start to belt out and
                hold that
                big long note, suddenly your voice begins to shake and crack and you run out of air. Gasping, to take
                your next
                breath, you realize that you totally missed the mark! Sound familiar? Have you ever felt short of breath
                as you
                struggled to hold out a note when singing a verse of a song? Cultivating proper Breath Support will
                allow you to
                have more breath control. Breath Support is pivotal in order to sustain each pitch duration accurately
                while
                singing. Learning to engage your diaphragm while singing will allow you to achieve appropriate breath
                support.
                The diaphragm is a muscle that sits below the lungs and plays a crucial role in the process of
                breathing. </p>

            <h3>Posture</h3>
            <p>Can you think back to the last time you heard a band perform live. How did they sound? How well were the
                acoustics? Hopefully when the musicians performed they were sure to position each instrument so the
                listeners or
                audience could enjoy their melodic sounds. You may have heard the expression “Your body is an
                instrument.” This
                is true for every singer regardless of your experience. Hence, to develop skills for a “solid singing
                technique”
                good Posture is key. Posture is import when singing as proper stance for singing allows air to flow
                freely down
                your windpipe and pass through your lungs allowing your listeners to enjoy your melodic sounds too.</p>
